## Background Information
The World Happiness Report is a survey that assesses the state of global happiness by ranking countries based on how happy their citizens perceive themselves to be. It is an increasingly valuable tool for governments, organizations, and civil societies in shaping their policy decisions.

## Datasets
The datasets we used were obtained from Kaggle. At the time of this project, Kaggle only has 2015-2019 data. For the project, we will be using 2015-2018 as our training data and comparing it to our 2019 testing data.

## Python Libraries
For this project, we used Python to analysis our data. The Python libraries that we used are:
* NumPy- data analysis
* Pandas- scientific computing
* Matplotlib- data visualization
* Seaborn- statistical visualization partnered with Matplotlib
* Scikit-learn- machine learning

## Contents
1. Exploratory Data Analysis
    * Cleaning and merging data
    * Central tendencies of happiness score over the years
    * Determine stable happienss rankings
    * Visualize relationships between the happiness score and the six key features of happiness
    * Determine which features best contribute to happiness of a country
2. Modeling and Question Answering
    * Linear Regression- model the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables.
    * Gradient Boosting- combining multiple weak predictive models, such as decision trees, to create a more accurate and robust model.
    * Random Forest- a meta estimator that fits a number of decision tree classifiers on various sub-samples of the dataset and uses averaging to improve the predictive accuracy and control over-fitting. Random forests combine predictions from other models, in this case they're decision trees. 

Overall, this project aimed to provide valuable insights on factors that influence happiness in a country and to make accurate predictions on happiness scores using machine learning models.
